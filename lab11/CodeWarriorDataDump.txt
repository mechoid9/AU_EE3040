Memory Dump From CodeWarrior Real-Time Debugger to a PC File

1. Drag desired variables from window Data:1 to window Data:2
   (otherwise you will get the entire microcontroller memory).
   
2. In window Data:2, expand the array that you wish to dump
   to the PC. Format the data to decimal, if desired.
   
3. In the Command window (lower right), type after the prompt:

    Data:2 < DUMP
    
    (There is a space before and after the "<" symbol.)
    
    The data is now dummed into the Command window, from which
    you can copy and paste into a text editor.
    
4. In Excel, you can import the text in "fixed width" columns.
   After this, apply everything you learned in previous courses
   to analyze data and create a nice report.
